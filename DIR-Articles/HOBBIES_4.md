Designing this portfolio opened up a sandbox for me to implement key features and designs that I had always appreciated in other websites. The clean, flush look of the sidebar toggle and dark mode switch, along with their smooth animations, are examples of features I highly value as a user from both an aesthetic and functional point of view. All professional websites should strive to dliver their content in an easy-to-read manner with minimum ambiguity, which is the fundamental mindset of a typical frontend developer.

UI/UX Designers are often perfectionists, and though their work does not delve much into system architecture, they deal with a different type of architecture: that which is actually seen by the end user. Through the countless creative ideas a designer may envision, often, they must ensure that their choices end up conforming to the perfect balance between appealing to the widest audience possible and staying original, unique.

Portfolio websites are a place where designers often explore as much as they can, pushing their ideas only limited by passion and determination. For my portfolio, I desired to create an organized blog-style web page with sections (divided chronologically) showcasing the biggest projects I have worked on, complete with tags for anyone curious about the technologies leveraged in each project. I wanted the functionality to support markdown rendering within article bodies. This was accomplished with **Marked.js**, and enabled me to write these pieces efficiently with the textual formatting I desired.

As for the colors, fonts, and other such fun stuff, I decided to stick with a minimalist approach. Grayscale colors with a tinge of orange highlights where needed, a carefully chosen Montsserat - JetBrains Mono - Segoe UI font set after staring at the [Google Fonts Catalog](https://fonts.google.com/) for a bit too long, and making sections collapsable wherever possible, all to keep things simple.
